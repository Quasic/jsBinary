# jsBinary
ECMAScript support for various binary formats

These scripts were originally part of [Quasic/scripts/format](https://github.com/Quasic/scripts), which included text formats, but were split out when they became dependent on [BinaryReadAppendStream.js](https://github.com/Quasic/jsBinary/BinaryReadAppendStream.js).
